                        Frequent travelers see many different types of things and train their brains to focus on the beautiful. Constant novelty keeps the mind and the eyes sharp. People who travel see beauty where others see the ordinary. This skill belongs to great photographers, poetic writers and fertilizes the garden where inspiration grows.

                        Travelers are always meeting new people. They become good at asking questions to learn about the people they meet and what their opinions are on their city and culture. The questions come naturally because of travelers curiosity and desire to learn about the places they visit. This inspires great conversations that help travelers understand and accept the person and their views on a deeper level. They make friends easily and are loved by many because of this.
